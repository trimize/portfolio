Quick summary:

            </pre>

42 is an IT school created by Xavier Niel CEO of Free.
It is a new way to learn, a project-oriented (solo and in groups), peer-learning way.
42 is in the top 10 of the World Universities with Real Impact (WURI).
It is one of the best (if not the best) IT training reference in the world.

To first get into the school you have to succeed it's infamous "piscine" where you have to send a plethora of exercises to
a unforgiving program thoroughly testing each one and if you have the sightest of mistake it is grade 0.
You also have to succeed in the exams and be a good peer to others as people can vouch for you if you are helpful or respectful and friendly.

Now that you are accepted in 42 there is several projects to do and they are all peer-evaluated (it is often times even more unforgiving than a program).
You can complete the projects to their maximum and beyond, they are all graded at 100, almost all have bonuses that grant 25 more points if fully done,
it is also possible to go beyond the bonuses or to make the project as good as possible to get the "Outstanding project" grade, giving you a star.
You, of course, have mulitple exams that you have to do between a x amount of projects done.

My journey:

            </pre>
            <pre class="detailsText">
During my 42 experience I have learned a lot of stuff wether it is new or deepen my knowledge.
I got the best possible grades in all the projects in 42, I did all the "bonuses" of the school,
in a large amount of the projects done I also got the "Outstanding project" grade.
I also learned to do my projects well-structured and It instaured standard of coding moving forward.
Here is a list of skills I learned or enhanced studying at 42:

                <div class="skillLogo" id="bashLogo"></div>
                <pre class="detailsText">
I have been able to learn a lot more for bash thanks to the minishell project,
I also tried to do several bash scripts to understand how the language works.
I will go in more details in the minishell page, but in summary I think it is fair to say
that I am more than familiar with bash.

            <div class="skillContainer">
                <pre class="detailsText">
I did a DOOM-like game in C, a server during an exam, a shell like terminal,
a library, sort algorithms, multi-threading, fractals.
It is safe to say that C does not have any secrets hiding from me now.
C also made me very wary of memory management in projects and code as one
error memory, 1 byte of memory unused or leaking was grade 0.
