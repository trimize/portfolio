## Installation

This will install and start a python http server.
Make sure you have python installed.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/trimize/portfolio.git
  cd portfolio
  python3 -m http.server 8000
```

In the browser of your choice (google chrome preferred right now), type this in the URL:

```
http://localhost:8000/HTML/LandingPage.html
```
